"Begin Programming: Build Your First Mobile Game"
I have refactored to include a Ball object, and changed the game so that
-- you start off with 1 ball
-- every time a ball hits the target (smiley face) you get an extra ball
-- every time you hit a ball with the paddle you get as many points as there are balls in play
-- the game is over once there is no ball left
